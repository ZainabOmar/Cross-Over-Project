# Cross|Over Project
Hope you like it.

So first of all you have to fork, clone then start working.
the steps of how to launch the project are found in the howTo.txt file.


## Missing requirements are:
1- Unfortunately I could not use socket.io, due to the time lack
2- I had also some issues while working on the map like:
not being able to add pins, also popup forms (I did it in other ways just to complete the functionality)
3- bringing users in the same place was also not done, all I wanted was more time.
4- Demo.txt file is also missing. (sorry for that ^_^)

## Feedback:
I had so much fun while working on the project, I have never get this kind of challenges before, I think it's all because I had only 4 days to finish full-stack website, and that what made the fun increases.
Maybe giving candidates more time is not a bad idea.
