## Solution:
At the begining we should think of how we can logically structure the data,
since we have 2 types of users then we need to distinguish between them.

For building front-end we need to focus on "single-page" website, so all the html code would be in the same page and that means faster page loading.


## Technologies:
1. Node.Js and express for the back-end.
2. MongoDB for data-base.
3. Angular2, Bootstrap for front-end.
4. ArcGIS to get the map.
